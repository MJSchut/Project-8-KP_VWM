<h1> This experiment mimics the Luck and Vogel working memory task </h1>

To run:
* Install requirements.txt
* Run main.py with Python 3.8.x

To change settings:
* Check settings in constants.py, most settings are mutable.
* Number of trials should be a multiple of set size, otherwise the trials may not be counterbalanced perfectly.
